                <p>Media design implies developing content which is to be published at different platforms and in different contexts.
                Digital is a new norm and everything that we see on the Web is not just websites.They are digital things, editions, services, applications, etc.A website is just a skin relevant to the environment.
                 Your words “I develop websites design” would mean the same sort of thing as “I do paper design” which strictly speaking includes everything from books to packaging.

                 <p>Digital transformation involves using digital technologies to change a business process to become more efficient or effective.
    The idea is to use technology not just to replicate an existing service in a digital form,but to use technology to transform that service into something significantly better.
It sounds simple but digital transformation can be a long, expensive and complicated process that doesn't always go according to plan.
